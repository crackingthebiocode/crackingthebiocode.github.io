                <h3 class="page-header">What inspired you to start research in computational biology?</h3>
                <big>
                <p>Unfortunately there was no literal moment of inspiration where I decided that I
				wanted to do computational biology. I had done very poorly in my undergraduate
				degree in molecular biology and so I found it very difficult to get an entry
				level job in the field afterwards. I remember sending out many resumes and
				getting nowhere. Ultimately I had to get any job that would pay, so after my
				degree I worked various roles including a door-to-door salesman, answering
				telephones in a call centre, and teaching English as a second language.</p>
                <p>After two years doing these jobs, I wanted to do something that gave me more
				fulfilment. I remember talking to my sister, who works in microbiology, and she
				suggested that I try doing bioinformatics as it was a new and interesting
				field. I thought it did sound interesting and so I applied for a couple of
				masters degree courses around the UK. I was accepted to the University of
				Newcastle. I really enjoyed this course and this is how I was able to start
				pursing a career in bioinformatics.</p>
                </big>
            </div>        
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <h3 class="page-header">What are 5 important skills needed for your research?</h3>
                <big>
                <ul>
                <li>Dedication. This is the one thing that I most recommend to anyone pursing a
				scientific career. Science is very exciting but sometimes it can be extremely
				boring. During these boring times is when you just have to put the hours in, no
				matter how dull it is. Things like revising a manuscript or updating figures
				for what feels like the hundredth are what's required to get something finished
				and completed. Once something is published you can look back and be proud.</li>
                <li>Continuing education. I don't think education finishes when you complete
				your university degree. I think you have to keep studying, this can be keeping
				up with the literature, learning a new programming language, or teaching
				yourself linear algebra. The most exciting and best people to work with are
				those who are hungry to learn new things.</li>
                <li>Aim to excel at what you do. I think when you start something you have to
				aim to do your absolute very best at it, otherwise why do it? Learn to say no
				to projects you think you might do half-heartily and commit 100% to the ones
				you say yes to. Always try to pay attention to the details as well, this can
				turn a good project into a great one. If you always do your best, other people
				will eventually start to notice, or if they don't go somewhere else that
				rewards your hard work.</li>
                <li>Surround yourself with very smart and hardworking people. There's only so
				much you can motivate yourself sometimes. If you work somewhere where everyone
				else is working hard and doing great work, you'll want to do the same. You'll
				start pushing yourself to be even better.</li>
                <li> Take time to relax. I think it's very important to have balance, you can't
				spend all your time working or you'll eventually hate it. I make an effort to
				not to do work or check emails on the weekend or in the evening. I try to work
				as hard as I can during the day, and then relax otherwise. I don't go home and
				watch TV though, instead doing something active helps me relax. Right now I've
				been learning to surf, and a few hours each day on the weekend helps me unwind
				so that I'm fresh to start again on Monday.</li>

                <h3 class="page-header">How did you learn the computational and quantitative skills necessary for your work?</h3>
                <big>
                <p>I learnt a great deal during my master's degree at the University of Newcastle.
				I learnt Java and R, as well as many of the basics of bioinformatics. Since
				then I have mostly been teaching myself through books and Coursea online
				courses. I am always interested in new programming languages as so much time in
				bioinformatics is spend writing code. Learning functional programming with
				Haskell was a really eye-opening experience that showed me how much better
				writing software can be. I like learning math and statistics and this usually
				from books and videos. A good grasp on linear algebra and statistical methods
				can really help you tackle difficult problems and get good answers.</p>

                <big>
                <p>I work at the JGI so most of what I do focus on sequencing and genome assembly.
				We look at what gives a good assembly and how various metrics in the sequence
				data relate to this. One current project - <a href="http://nucleotid.es/"><b>nucleotid.es</b></a>, aims to provide
				objective benchmarks for genome assemblers.</p>
